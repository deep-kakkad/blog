His tweets (and even just a handful of them) and other writeups, I believe has taught me more than books.</p>\n<p>Yesterday, he tweeted something in the lines of - 'Do something even before it has a name'. I don't know how it interconnected and inspired me to read all of his tweets. This sounds crazy, but I really wish to one day, read all of his 26.5k tweets.</p>\n<p>This led me to the idea of collecting some of his best tweets in one place.</p>\n<p><em>Caution - I'm sleepy after working on this for like 7 hours straight (or maybe more, I may have lost the count haha), after work. This may have some typos, but I wanted to get my lessons out here as raw as possible :)</em></p>\n<hr>\n<p>So, coming back.</p>\n<p>Starts a quick side-project brainstorming around midnight.</p>\n<p>First go-to was doing a <a href=\"http://www.producthunt.com/\">PH</a> like upvote-y thing. I could've done this using an app called Pory, but I did a very similar thing last week and wanted to get out that comfort zone of using the same tool, plus I wanted something better looking.</p>\n<p>Went on to bubble to build this...</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/NE3w5TaPraiMATJtdMHHPJOw2Zcil1TPh9MVwP7Rv13s-lx2DqUA9P8yddLyrGxQtT2eEMdjv-eoehem26OP-Qs9Kd4bCf1vZmnPpRWM-AVvlOSTgnlHGCjIQ0w5ZtXf0HRx3cGI\">https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/NE3w5TaPraiMATJtdMHHPJOw2Zcil1TPh9MVwP7Rv13s-lx2DqUA9P8yddLyrGxQtT2eEMdjv-eoehem26OP-Qs9Kd4bCf1vZmnPpRWM-AVvlOSTgnlHGCjIQ0w5ZtXf0HRx3cGI</a></p>\n<p>After spending what felt like an hour, I had this working prototype but not something I'd be proud to share with Sahil. Plus, this also seemed to be consuming more time than I expected.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>For the sake of simplicity, I moved to Notion, where after again going through tons of templates I settled for this simple thing.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/qGxOejc4Z8E5zePemKFErysZAqumnxUf277_mgbWqf_-Bt9fexlTrAiLQRXHryi-TM7dDTKtDTh5xW9ClqrKNReJ2U3UAgBRPztuN2QcvT-eQVx4RcDndyPaGuvUpPBvnn_Q27An\">https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/qGxOejc4Z8E5zePemKFErysZAqumnxUf277_mgbWqf_-Bt9fexlTrAiLQRXHryi-TM7dDTKtDTh5xW9ClqrKNReJ2U3UAgBRPztuN2QcvT-eQVx4RcDndyPaGuvUpPBvnn_Q27An</a></p>\n<p>A few tweets in, and I dropped on this too. Looked too simple and boring.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>While building on both of these tools, I felt I wanted something better looking. Hence, the next tool - Webflow.</p>\n<p>Now, I've used Webflow CMS a bit and tried my hands on designing on Webflow, but even after being good at HTML, CSS, Javascript - couldn't get a hang on Webflow designing concepts.</p>\n<p>Went to <a href=\"http://flowbase.co/\">Flowbase</a> to check if I could use any of their Webflow templates to make it easier for me. Tried a few templates, but here are the problems I felt with them -</p>\n<ol>\n<li>It was hard to manipulate the templates to make them work my way (as a newbie)</li>\n<li>I felt I wasn't learning anything</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Nothing better than starting from scratch, I thought. And I feel that was the best decision.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Started a Webflow project from a blank screen. Played around with rich text elements.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-j9sCxiaIsF6gwZNcPLdIWU4GFf8za46WiHFSljJI_0CnvM5egekiFt8NI7O048q2T2556Id5wHSkWy7cj_z2w2shZ5pKfFDyha5S2QCUosKVg9uNA1_L_DRDnO_gugTKHAVtbeq\">https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-j9sCxiaIsF6gwZNcPLdIWU4GFf8za46WiHFSljJI_0CnvM5egekiFt8NI7O048q2T2556Id5wHSkWy7cj_z2w2shZ5pKfFDyha5S2QCUosKVg9uNA1_L_DRDnO_gugTKHAVtbeq</a></p>\n<p>Created my first collection (database) and connected it to the frontend. The collection/database is supposed to be the tweets I want to show on the page.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/_R2VWrKJMCkBb-3EBMirUmRLpO3wOknIKc6q3MPom7uOazFWW6DShj6HQRXIHpm2xqksZL01ePkEBqOoobJ-Y3TjDmHCVNNNponkDE_vMm7VyiLplB9M67goqrmqV9EaBbJ8E-ow\">https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/_R2VWrKJMCkBb-3EBMirUmRLpO3wOknIKc6q3MPom7uOazFWW6DShj6HQRXIHpm2xqksZL01ePkEBqOoobJ-Y3TjDmHCVNNNponkDE_vMm7VyiLplB9M67goqrmqV9EaBbJ8E-ow</a></p>\n<p>The next step - Simply put on the heading and now that I knew how to create a database, and connect it with the frontend and how to manipulate it, I went on to flowbase just to use the cute-little card you see in the below Screenshot.</p>\n<p>Oh, BTW - it was around this time when I opened up my LinkedIn to find out that it is his birthday. At the initiation of the project, I didn't even know. The co-incidence was a good boost.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/M2z_45ECuUlWfgS1NQ50n3f6Lr5Qw2mMvi9IHJaWQ-Wm9VNbon5WNpm4_5B_NzKxJnKDeFi1lAqdceEopyUjOEI90LlkCchkZ8YJv_Mqz4tDGEJarqXYn_HymSkGsCMeIKaCZpUp\">https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/M2z_45ECuUlWfgS1NQ50n3f6Lr5Qw2mMvi9IHJaWQ-Wm9VNbon5WNpm4_5B_NzKxJnKDeFi1lAqdceEopyUjOEI90LlkCchkZ8YJv_Mqz4tDGEJarqXYn_HymSkGsCMeIKaCZpUp</a></p>\n<p>This was the moment, I knew that this is the kind of design I was looking for and ditched Notion and Bubble for. A cute looking card, that links to the original tweet.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/7KWs-ub68BXVA5b5hzHunipOFbOJUBnD6Ywft3qRu8oJDebveiuBm29AaRCwzg0XJgQVSOiW9kkhdUuG02R6ASbtRTeynME7tBAl8D9p8NphRQIwqP2rRtHTDJucdtFucWXMe8kq\">https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/7KWs-ub68BXVA5b5hzHunipOFbOJUBnD6Ywft3qRu8oJDebveiuBm29AaRCwzg0XJgQVSOiW9kkhdUuG02R6ASbtRTeynME7tBAl8D9p8NphRQIwqP2rRtHTDJucdtFucWXMe8kq</a></p>\n<p>I tried various sizes and various cards.</p>\n<p>Now, everything was fine until there were more cards when I figured out that the background images need a 'black overlay' so that the text is readable.</p>\n<p>I tried searching for ways and found a few tutorials but nothing worked.</p>\n<p>So, I went on to <a href=\"http://canva.com/\">Canva</a> and added overlay to all the background images manually, urgh! ðŸ˜£</p>\n<p>But the final output was worth the work...</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/6r4WM5AtiKraYH7WxfEjHCQ7DgCxyCR8-h2bfFh3T1Dl1nPjPhMyrRbs_6hwDvhm30sj4TTVCFfHmE-zHLoJFx4q2xvoEnzAAMlxbijw_c_JgrRR8kZJV9trFutG_Ljh-kYPeHhO\">https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/6r4WM5AtiKraYH7WxfEjHCQ7DgCxyCR8-h2bfFh3T1Dl1nPjPhMyrRbs_6hwDvhm30sj4TTVCFfHmE-zHLoJFx4q2xvoEnzAAMlxbijw_c_JgrRR8kZJV9trFutG_Ljh-kYPeHhO</a></p>\n<hr>\n<p>Why am I doing this?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I would love to get my birthday wishes noticed by him</li>\n<li>Even if he doesn't notice, I'll learn a few Webflow concepts</li>\n<li>His tweets are real gems, I think people like me would appreciate a repository like this one.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>Updates</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/DKakkad99/status/1298304736622387200\">Tweeted here</a>, Sahil noticed and liked the tweet in moments ðŸ™‚</p>",
